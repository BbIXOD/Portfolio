Examples of my work

To run game just go _Builds_->_*Name of the game*_->Find exe file

1. Tanks is a multyplayer game only, so for testing you can run it twice on one pc, join room with similar name on both windows (without name = room named "Server")
2. Ballz it`s a simple game, quickly made, i will port it to android soon.
3. Alchemist is my first but still interesting fps with unique mechanics.
